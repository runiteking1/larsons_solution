\begin{Exercise}
	This problem is quite simple.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $4c=5s$ where $c$ is the number of people of ordered cheesecake, and $s$ the number who ordered strudel.
		\item $6s = p$ where $p, s$ is the number of professors and students respectively.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Exercise}
Let the height of the crossing be denoted $h$, and let the left pole be of height $x$ and the right pole of height $y$.
We seek to establish a relationship between the three variables, which we will do using similar triangles.

Let the distance between the bases of the two pole be denoted $c = c_1 + c_2$ where $c_1$ is the segment from the left pole
to the crossing, and $c_2$ the segment from the right pole to the crossing. 
We can then write the following expression from viewing the similar triangles:
\begin{align}
	\frac{c_2 x}{c_1 + c_2} = \frac{h}{c_2}
\end{align}
Similarly for the other variable:
\begin{align}
	\frac{c_1 y}{c_1 + c_2} = \frac{h}{c_1}.
\end{align}

Combining the two and solving for $\frac{x}{y}$, we have $\frac{x}{y} = \frac{c_1}{c_2}$. 
Now:
\begin{align}
	h &= \frac{c_2 x}{c_1 + c_2} \\
	&= \frac{x}{\frac{c_1}{c_2} + 1} \\
	&= \frac{x}{\frac{x}{y} + 1} \\
	&= \frac{xy}{x+y}
\end{align} \qed
