\begin{Exercise}
	Began by noting that if the denominators are both positive, then the inequality will never be true. 
	For simplicity, let's break up the problem into two cases:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $x-1 < 0 < x+1 \rightarrow -1 < x < 1$
		\item $x-1 < x + 1 < 0$.
	\end{enumerate}

	Let's consider the second case first, which is easily solved
	\begin{align*}
		\frac{3}{x-1} &< \frac{2}{x+1} \\
		3x + 3 &< 2x - 2 \\
		x &< -5
	\end{align*}

	As for the first case, just be careful to flip the sign
	\begin{align*}
		\frac{3(x+1)}{x-1} &< 2 \\
		3x + 3 &> 2x - 2 \\
		x &> -5
	\end{align*}
	and note that we have the constraint that $|x| < 1$. \qed

\begin{Exercise}
	Let's start with working out the base cases of 0 and 1.
	They are $F(1)^2 - F(1) = 2$ and $F(0)^2 - F(0) = 0$.
	Obviously, there's two answers for each of the equations above, but checking each case reveals that $F(1) = 2, F(0) = 1$.

	Now it's easy to prove that $F(x)=x+1$ for all integers by $F(x)F(1) - F(x) = 2F(x) - F(x) = F(x) = x + 1$.
	Heck, using this argument it extends to all the reals! \qed
